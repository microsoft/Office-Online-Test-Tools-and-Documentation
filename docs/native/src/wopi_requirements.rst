=====================================================================

Note: Following section is applicable |Office iOS Android|. Both of these endpoints require the same level of WOPI implementation.

This section documents specific requirements for your WOPI implementation for integration with |Office iOS Android| beyond
what is documented in general for WOPI. You can learn more about how |Office iOS Android| uses these operations in the
:ref:`operational flows` section.
