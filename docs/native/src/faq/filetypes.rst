..  note::

    Modern file type documents can be edited directly.
   
    When users attempt to edit documents in the legacy formats, they will be prompted to convert the file to a modern
    format. |Office iOS| will convert the legacy document to the modern format and save it as a new document alongside
    the existing document.
