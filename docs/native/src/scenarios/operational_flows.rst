Operational flows for |Office iOS| and |Office Android|
========================================================

This section outlines the implementation requirements and operational flows for user scenarios outlined in the
:ref:`browse files` section.


Terminology
-----------

User
    Self-explanatory

Office Client
    The |Office iOS Android| app, i.e. Excel/Word/PowerPoint

Office Identity Service
    The Office Identity service is a service |Office iOS Android| uses for handling user identity information. In OAuth flows,
    the Office Identity Service behaves as the External User Agent

Bootstrapper URL
    URL which the Storage Provider hosts to allow an Office Client app with a valid OAuth 2.0 access token to retrieve
    a WOPI access token

Token Endpoint URL
    URL which the Storage Provider hosts and uses in order to generate access or refresh tokens

Services Manager
    Office-owned service which stores a Service Catalog, listing all of the available services for an app or endpoint

Storage provider
    Refers to a CSPP partner who has integrated their service into |Office iOS Android|

..  note::
    * Any time during these flows that |Office iOS Android| tries to hit the bootstrapper and have expired or invalid OAuth
      credentials, |Office iOS Android| will ask the user to log in again.
    * Any time during these flows that |Office iOS Android| has a missing, invalid, or expired WOPI access token, |Office iOS Android|
      will attempt to get a valid WOPI access token by calling :ref:`GetNewAccessToken`.


Add a Place
-----------

This describes the first time a user adds your storage provider using the :guilabel:`Add a Place` in |Office iOS Android|. To
correctly authenticate users, we use the following operational flow in order to connect a user's storage provider
account with their |Office iOS Android| account.

    :alt: Image representation of the authentication flow for adding a place.


#. When the Office client boots, it calls the Services Manager for a list of available services. The Services Manager
   returns a Service Catalog, which is an alphabetically-sorted list of available providers and places which the user
   can connect to.
#. When the user clicks :guilabel:`Add a Place` in the |Office iOS Android| backstage, they see your Storage Provider listed
   as an available place.
#. When the users adds the Storage Provider, the Office client makes an unauthenticated :ref:`Bootstrap` call.
#. The :ref:`Bootstrap` response includes the Authorization URI and token issue URI. Note that the Authorization URI
   must be provided as part of your :ref:`onboarding` so we can add it as a trusted domain.
#. |Office iOS Android| loads the Authorization URI in a web view which prompts the user to sign in with the service
   provider.  Once the user finishes the sign in process, the web view reaches a redirect URI which causes it to close.
   The redirect URI also provides an auth code to |Office iOS Android|.
#. |Office iOS Android| sends the auth code and token issue URI to the Office Identity Service.
#. The Office Identity Service sends the auth code and the client secret to the Token endpoint.
#. The Token Endpoint issues an access token and a refresh token (if available) back to the Office Identity Service.
#. The Office Identity Service makes an authenticated :ref:`Bootstrap` call using the access token to retrieve the user
   profile information.
#. The Office Identity Service sends the access and refresh tokens and the user profile information to |Office iOS Android|.
#. The user has now added the Storage Provider as a place. For the operational flow on browsing, opening, and saving
   files, see the next sections.


Browsing and opening files
--------------------------

Here is the operational flow for browsing and opening files.

#. *Get the Root Container URL:* |Office iOS Android| calls :ref:`GetRootContainer (bootstrapper)` to obtain a Root Container
   URL.
#. *Get the contents of the container:* |Office iOS Android| calls :ref:`EnumerateChildren` on the Root Container. The
   results are a set of containers and files in the root container. If the user wants to browse to another container
   within the current container, |Office iOS Android| calls :ref:`CheckContainerInfo` on the other container to check
   permissions, then calls :ref:`EnumerateChildren` on that second container. This step is repeated as the user
   browses the container hierarchy, until the user selects the file they want to open.
#. *Check file permissions:* Once the user selects a file, |Office iOS Android| calls :ref:`CheckFileInfo` on that file to
   verify that the user has permissions to the file.
#. *Check file lock:*

   * If the earlier :ref:`CheckFileInfo` call returned ``true`` for :term:`SupportsGetLock`, |Office iOS Android| calls
     :ref:`GetLock`. If the :ref:`GetLock` response is a :http:statuscode:`409` or includes an **X-WOPI-Lock**
     header, the file is locked and |Office iOS Android| does not continue opening it.
   * If the earlier :ref:`CheckFileInfo` call returned ``true`` for :term:`SupportsGetLock`, |Office iOS Android| sends a
     :ref:`RefreshLock` request with a known invalid lock ID. If the :ref:`RefreshLock` response is a
     :http:statuscode:`409` with a lock ID in the **X-WOPI-Lock** response header, the file is locked and |Office iOS Android|
     does not continue opening it.

#. *Take a lock on the file:* |Office iOS Android| calls :ref:`Lock` on the file, passing a lock ID it wishes to use in the
   **X-WOPI-Lock** request header. If the :ref:`Lock` call returns a :http:statuscode:`200`, the file is locked.
   |Office iOS Android| will use the same lock ID when making future :Ref:`PutFile` requests.
#. *Download the file:* |Office iOS Android| makes a :ref:`GetFile` request on the file.


Saving and closing a file
-------------------------

#. *Save the file:* If the user has made changes to the file, |Office iOS Android| will update the file's contents by calling
   :ref:`PutFile`. The :ref:`PutFile` request will include the current WOPI lock ID previously used by |Office iOS Android|
   to lock the file.
#. *Unlock the file:* |Office iOS Android| will make an :ref:`Unlock` request against to unlock the file. This :ref:`Unlock`
   request will include the current WOPI lock ID previously used by |Office iOS Android| to lock the file.
