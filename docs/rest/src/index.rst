The Web Application Open Platform Interface Protocol (WOPI) defines a set of operations that enables a client to
access and change files stored by a server. WOPI is a REST-based protocol. It defines a set of
:ref:`REST endpoints<endpoints>` as well as operations that can be executed by issuing HTTP requests to those
endpoints.

The WOPI protocol is used by Office applications, such as |wac|, to view and edit files that are stored in
a cloud service. Thus, |wac| is a :term:`WOPI client`, while the cloud service that stores the files is a
:term:`WOPI server`, often referred to as a *host*.

This documentation is a reference for all of the defined WOPI operations. However, not all operations must be
implemented. WOPI is modular and a WOPI server need only implement the operations required by the WOPI client(s) the
server intends to integrate with. To learn more about the specific requirements for integrating with |wac| or
|Office iOS Android|, see the sections below:
