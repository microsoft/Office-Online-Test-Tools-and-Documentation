EnumerateChildren (containers)
==============================

:Required for: |ios| |android|

..  default-domain:: http

..  get:: /wopi/containers/(container_id)/children

    ..  todo:: Add note explaining that paging is deliberately not supported.

    The |operation| operation enumerates all the immediate children of a given :term:`container`. Note that paging is
    deliberately not supported by this operation. Responses are expected to include all immediate children of the
    container.

    ..  include:: /_fragments/common_containers_params.rst

    :reqheader X-WOPI-FileExtensionFilterList:
        A **string** value that the host must use to filter the returned child files. This header must be a list of
        comma-separated file extensions with a leading dot (``.``). There must be no whitespace and no trailing
        comma in the string. Wildcard characters are not permitted.

        If this header is included, the host must only return child files whose file extensions match the filter
        list, based on a case-insensitive match. For example, if this header is set to the value ``.doc,.docx``, the host
        should include only files with the ``doc`` or ``docx`` file extension.

        This header value only affects the child files that are returned; it does not have any effect on child
        containers.

    :code 404: Resource not found/user unauthorized
