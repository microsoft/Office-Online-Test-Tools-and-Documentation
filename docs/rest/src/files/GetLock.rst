    The |operation| operation retrieves a lock on a file. Note that this operation *does not create a new lock.* Rather,
    this operation always returns the current lock value in the **X-WOPI-Lock** response header. Because of this, its
    semantics differ slightly from the other lock-related operations.

    If the file is currently not locked, the host must return a :http:statuscode:`200` and include an **X-WOPI-Lock**
    response header set to the empty string.

    If the file is currently locked, the host should return a :http:statuscode:`200` and include an **X-WOPI-Lock**
    response header containing the value of the current lock on the file. If the current lock ID is not representable
    as a WOPI lock (for example, it is longer than the :ref:`maximum lock length <lock length>`), the host should
    return a :http:statuscode:`409` and set the **X-WOPI-Lock** response header to the empty string or omit
    it completely.

    ..  tip::
        While a :http:statuscode:`409` is technically a valid response to this operation, it is rarely needed in
        practice, and hosts should respond with a :http:statuscode:`200` in most cases.

    See :term:`Lock` for more general information regarding locks.

    :reqheader X-WOPI-Override:
        The **string** ``GET_LOCK``. Required.

    :resheader X-WOPI-Lock:
        A **string** value identifying the current lock on the file. Unlike other lock operations, this header is
        required when responding to the request with either :http:statuscode:`200` or :http:statuscode:`409`.
