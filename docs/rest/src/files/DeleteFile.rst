DeleteFile
==========

:Required for: |ios| |android|

..  default-domain:: http

..  post:: /wopi/files/(file_id)

    The |operation| operation deletes a file from a host.

    If the file is currently locked, the host should return a :http:statuscode:`409` and include an **X-WOPI-Lock**
    response header containing the value of the current lock on the file. If the current lock ID is not representable
    as a WOPI lock (for example, it is longer than the :ref:`maximum lock length <lock length>`), the host should
    return a :http:statuscode:`409` and set the **X-WOPI-Lock** response header to the empty string or omit
    it completely.
