PutFile
=======

:Required for: |web| |ios| |android|

..  default-domain:: http

..  post:: /wopi/files/(file_id)/contents

    The |operation| operation updates a file's binary contents.

    ..  include:: /_fragments/priorlock.rst

    When a host receives a |operation| request on a file that is not locked, the host must check the current size of the
    file. If it is 0 bytes, the |operation| request should be considered valid and should proceed. If it is any value
    other than 0 bytes, or is missing altogether, the host should respond with a :http:statuscode:`409`. For more
    information, see :ref:`Create New`.

    If the file is currently locked and the **X-WOPI-Lock** value does not match the lock currently on the file the
    host must return a "lock mismatch" response (:http:statuscode:`409`) and include an **X-WOPI-Lock** response
    header containing the value of the current lock on the file. In the case where the file is unlocked, the host
    must set **X-WOPI-Lock** to the empty string.

    :reqheader X-WOPI-Override:
        The **string** ``PUT``. Required.
    :reqheader X-WOPI-Lock:
        A **string** provided by the WOPI client in a previous :ref:`Lock` request. Note that this header will not be
        included during :ref:`document creation<Create New>`.
    :reqheader X-WOPI-Editors:
        A comma-delimited **string** of :term:`UserId` values representing all the users who contributed changes
        to the document in this PutFile request.

    :request Body: The request body must be the full binary contents of the file.
