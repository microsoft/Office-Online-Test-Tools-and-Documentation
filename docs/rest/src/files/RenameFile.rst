..  _RenameFile:

RenameFile
==========

..  default-domain:: http

..  post:: /wopi/files/(file_id)

    The |operation| operation renames a file.

    ..  important::
        Renaming the file must not cause the :term:`File ID`, and by extension, the :term:`WOPISrc`, to change.

    If the host cannot rename the file because the name requested is invalid or conflicts with an existing file, the
    host should try to generate a different name based on the requested name that meets the file name requirements.

    If the host cannot generate a different name, it should return an HTTP status code :http:statuscode:`400`. The
    response must include an **X-WOPI-InvalidFileNameError** header that describes why the file name was invalid.

    If the file is currently unlocked, the host should respond with a :statuscode:`200` and proceed with the rename.

    If the file is currently locked and the **X-WOPI-Lock** value does not match the lock currently on the file the
    host must return a "lock mismatch" response (:http:statuscode:`409`) and include an **X-WOPI-Lock** response
    header containing the value of the current lock on the file.

    ..  admonition:: |wac| Tip

        |wac| includes contains UI that users can use to rename files. In order to activate this UI in |wac|, you
        must implement the |operation| operation, and also do the following:

        * Set :term:`SupportsRename` and :term:`UserCanRename` to true in your :ref:`CheckFileInfo` response.
        * Set a :term:`FileNameMaxLength` value if the default value is not correct for your WOPI host.

    ..  include:: /_fragments/common_params.rst

    :reqheader X-WOPI-Override:
        The **string** ``RENAME_FILE``. Required.
    :reqheader X-WOPI-Lock:
        A **string** provided by the WOPI client that the host must use to identify the lock on the file.
    :reqheader X-WOPI-RequestedName:
        A UTF-7 encoded **string** that is a file name, *not including the file extension.*

    :resheader X-WOPI-InvalidFileNameError:
        A **string** describing the reason the rename operation could not be completed. This header should only be
        included when the response code is :http:statuscode:`400`. This value must only be used for logging purposes.

    :resheader X-WOPI-Lock:
        ..  include:: /_fragments/headers/X-WOPI-Lock.rst

    :resheader X-WOPI-LockFailureReason:
        ..  include:: /_fragments/headers/X-WOPI-LockFailureReason.rst

    :resheader X-WOPI-LockedByOtherInterface:
        ..  include:: /_fragments/headers/X-WOPI-LockedByOtherInterface.rst


    :code 200: Success
    :code 400: Specified name is illegal
    :code 401: Invalid :term:`access token`
    :code 404: Resource not found/user unauthorized
    :code 409: Lock mismatch/locked by another interface; an **X-WOPI-Lock** response header containing the value of
        the current lock on the file must always be included when using this response code
    :code 500: Server error
    :code 501: Operation not supported

    ..  include:: /_fragments/common_headers.rst

Response
--------

The response to a |operation| call is JSON (as specified in :rfc:`4627`) containing a single required property:

Name
    The **string** name of the renamed file *without a path or file extension.*

    ..  important::

        The **Name** property returned must *not* include the file extension. This is different than other similar
        WOPI operations such as :ref:`PutRelativeFile` and :ref:`CreateChildFile`.
