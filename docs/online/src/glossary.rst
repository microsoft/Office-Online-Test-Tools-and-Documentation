    Broadcast
        A broadcast is a special |wac| scenario where navigation through a document is driven by one or more
        presenters. A set of attendees can follow along with the presenter remotely.

    Host Page
    Host Frame
    Outer Frame
        The host page (also called the 'host frame' or 'outer frame') is the HTML page which will host an iframe that
        points to an |wac| application.

    Session Context
        The Session Context is an optional parameter that a host can include on a WOPI request. It is a **string**, and
        is passed to |wac| in the ``sc`` query string parameter. If included on a WOPI request, |wac| will return the
        value of ``sc`` as the value of the **X-WOPI-SessionContext** HTTP header when making the :ref:`CheckFileInfo`
        and :ref:`CheckFolderInfo` WOPI requests.
