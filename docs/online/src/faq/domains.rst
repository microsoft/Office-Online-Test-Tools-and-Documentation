Can I add new domains to the WOPI domain allow list after launch?
=================================================================

Yes, domains can be added or existing domains changed after launch. However, we do request that these changes be
relatively infrequent, and encourage hosts to use a domain scheme that does not require constant changes.

Contact Microsoft via the CSPP Yammer group to request changes to your domain entries.
