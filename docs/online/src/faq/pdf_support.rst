Why do I get an error when I try to view PDF documents in |wac|?
================================================================

PDF viewing in |wac| is not included as part of the Cloud Storage Partner Program. We are in the process of
deprecating the feature over the coming months, and are not supporting this integration as part of the Cloud Storage
Partner Program. We are also deprecating this support for Microsoft products such as OneDrive. OneDrive no longer
uses |wac| for PDF viewing.

Much has changed since |wac| originally added PDF viewing support. In particular, most modern browsers have excellent
built-in PDF support within the browser, and most mobile devices have excellent native PDF support as well. These
industry advances have made the reasons support was originally added obsolete.
