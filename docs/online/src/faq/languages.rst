    Updated list to reflect the addition/removal of several languages.

|wac| supports over 100 languages. In order to control the language of the |wac| UI, see the
:term:`UI_LLCC` placeholder value.

..  important::
    When replacing the :term:`UI_LLCC` parameter, do not use the *LCID* value from the table below. Instead, use the
    *Locale ID* value. You may also use any value provided it is in the format described in :rfc:`1766`.
