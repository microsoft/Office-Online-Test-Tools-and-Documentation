How does |wac| determine the datacenter to route a given user to?
=================================================================

When using |wac| to view and edit documents stored in external (non-Microsoft) storage, users are typically
routed to the |wac| datacenter closest to their current geographic location. However, this routing is not guaranteed,
and users may be routed to any global datacenter for a variety of reasons.

Thus, |wac| **does not guarantee that data will stay within a particular geographical region** when used to view and
edit documents stored in external (non-Microsoft) storage.
