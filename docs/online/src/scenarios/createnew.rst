Creating new files using |wac|
==============================

Hosts can create new Office files using blank document templates from |wac|. In order to support this, hosts use
the :wopi:action:`editnew` WOPI action as follows:

#. Create a zero-byte file with the appropriate file extension (``docx`` for Word documents, ``pptx`` for PowerPoint
   presentations, and ``xlsx`` for Excel workbooks).
#. Invoke the :wopi:action:`editnew` action on the newly created file. |wac| will detect that the file is
   zero bytes based on the :term:`Size` property in the :ref:`CheckFileInfo` response.
#. Once the :wopi:action:`editnew` action has been invoked, |wac| will perform a :ref:`PutFile` operation on
   the file, overwriting it with template content appropriate to the file type. Note that this :ref:`PutFile`
   operation will be performed on an unlocked file, so hosts must ensure that :ref:`PutFile` operations on
   unlocked files that are zero bytes succeed. See the :ref:`PutFile` documentation for more information.


..  important::

    Because the new file creation is done in two steps, it is possible for the :ref:`PutFile` operation to fail,
    leaving the zero-byte file. Since such a file is not valid, hosts should expect and handle this case. The ultimate
    solution is left to the host; options for handling this situation include:

    * Hide zero-byte files from the user.
    * Prevent users from opening zero-byte files in |wac|.
    * If a file is zero bytes, then when opening |wac| against the file, always use the :wopi:action:`editnew` action.
      (This is only an option if the user has edit permissions to the document.)

    This is not an exhaustive list of options; ultimately, the host must decide the best approach to this problem.
