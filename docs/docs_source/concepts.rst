Key concepts
============

The following concepts are referred to extensively within this documentation, and understanding them is important to
understanding the requirements for Office Online integration.


..  glossary::

    File ID
        A File ID is a string that represents a file or folder being operated on by Office Online via WOPI operations.
        A host must issue a unique ID for any file used by Office Online. Office Online will, in turn, include the
        file ID when making requests to the WOPI host. Thus, a host must be able to use the file ID to locate a
        particular file.

        A file ID must:

        * Represent a single Office document.
        * Be a URL-safe string because IDs are passed in URLs, principally via the :term:`WOPISrc` parameter.
        * Remain the same when the file is moved, renamed, or edited.
        * In the case of shared documents, the ID for a given file must be the same for every user that accesses the
          file.

        Note that the file ID is not provided to Office Online directly. Rather, it is passed as part of the
        :term:`WOPISrc` value. See :ref:`Action URLs` and :ref:`Appending WOPISrc` for more information about how the
        file ID should be passed to Office Online.

    Access token
        An access token is a string used by the host to determine the identity and permissions of the issuer of a
        WOPI request.

        The WOPI host that stores the file has the information about user permissions, not Office Online. For this
        reason, the WOPI host must provide an access token that Office Online will then pass back to it on subsequent
        WOPI requests. When the WOPI host receives the token, it either validates it, or responds with an HTTP status
        code if the token is invalid or unauthorized.

        An access token is generated by the host and passed to Office Online using the ``access_token`` parameter
        before the first WOPI request. See :ref:`Action URLs` and :ref:`Passing access tokens securely` for more
        information about how access tokens should be passed to Office Online.

        Office Online requires no understanding of the format or content of the token; Office Online simply includes
        it in WOPI requests and expects the host to validate it. However, Office Online does make some assumptions
        about access tokens and their behavior. In particular, access tokens used for Office Online must adhere to
        the following guidelines:

        * Access tokens must be scoped to a single user and document combination. Office Online will never assume that
          an access token issued for a particular user/document combination is valid for a different user/document
          combination.
        * Access tokens must be valid for the :ref:`user permissions <permissions>` that are provided by the host in
          the :ref:`CheckFileInfo` response. For example, if the :wopi:action:`view` action is invoked, and the
          :term:`UserCanWrite` property is set to ``true`` in the :ref:`CheckFileInfo` response, then Office Online
          will re-use that token when transitioning to edit mode. Thus, Office Online expects that any access token
          is valid for operations that the user has permissions to perform. If a host wishes to issue access tokens
          that are more narrowly scoped, then the :ref:`user permissions properties <permissions>` in the
          :ref:`CheckFileInfo` response must reflect the permissions that the token provides.
        * Access tokens should expire (become invalid) automatically after a period of time. Hosts can use the
          :term:`access_token_ttl` property to specify when an access token expires.

        ..  important::
            Office Online expects that an access token will remain valid until it expires (as indicated by the
            :term:`access_token_ttl` value). Hosts should not revoke access tokens as a standard part of their
            operations; tokens should only be revoked if a user's permissions have changed or been revoked.

            If hosts revoke access tokens regularly, users may experience strange behavior in Office Online. For
            example, in some cases Office Online will time out a user's session and present them with a dialog asking
            if they'd like to refresh their session. If the access token is not yet expired based on the
            :term:`access_token_ttl`, Office Online will refresh the session using the existing access token,
            assuming that it is still valid.

            There are a number of cases like this. For this reason, access tokens should remain valid until their
            expiry.


    access_token_ttl
        The access_token_ttl property tells Office Online when an access token expires, represented as the
        number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 (the date epoch in JavaScript). Despite its misleading name,
        it does *not* represent a duration of time for which the access token is valid. The access_token_ttl is never
        used by itself; it is always attached to a specific access token.

        To prevent data loss for users, Office Online will prompt users to save and refresh their sessions if the
        access token for their session is close to expiring. In order to do this, Office Online needs to know when
        the access token will expire, which it determines based on the access_token_ttl value.

        Hosts can set the access_token_ttl value to ``0``. This will effectively tell Office Online that the
        token expiry is either infinite or unknown. In this case, Office Online will disable any UI prompting users
        to refresh their sessions. This can lead to unexpected data loss due to access token expiry, so specifying a
        value for access_token_ttl is strongly recommended.

        ..  note::

            Future versions of Office Online may rename this parameter so its name is less confusing.


    Lock
        A lock is a conceptual construct that is associated with a file. Locks serve two purposes in Office Online:

        1. First, a lock prevents anyone other than the lock owner from making changes to a file. Office Online will
           lock files prior to editing them to prevent other entities from changing the file while Office Online is
           also editing them.
        2. A lock is also used by Office Online to store a small bit of temporary data associated with a file. This
           metadata is called the *lock ID* and is a string with a maximum length of 256 ASCII characters. Office
           Online uses this metadata for a variety of purposes, but hosts do not need any knowledge or understanding
           of the contents of the lock ID. Hosts must treat it as an opaque string.

        Therefore, Office Online locks must:

        * Be associated with a single file.
        * Contain a lock ID of maximum length 256 ASCII characters.
        * Prevent all changes to that file unless a proper lock ID is provided.
        * Expire after 30 minutes unless refreshed (see :ref:`RefreshLock`).

        All WOPI operations that modify files, such as :ref:`PutFile`, will include a lock ID as a parameter in their
        request. Usually the ID will be passed in the **X-WOPI-Lock** request header (but not always;
        :ref:`UnlockAndRelock` is an exception). Office Online expects hosts to compare the lock ID passed in a WOPI
        request with the lock ID currently on a file and respond appropriately when the lock IDs do not match. In
        particular, Office Online expects that when a lock ID does *not* match the current lock, the host will send
        back the current lock ID in the **X-WOPI-Lock** response header. This behavior is critical, because Office
        Online will use the current lock ID in order to determine what further WOPI calls to make to the host.

        WOPI does not currently define a GetLock operation. Instead, Office Online will often execute lock-related
        operations on files with missing or known incorrect lock IDs and expects the host to provide the current lock
        ID in its WOPI response. Typically the :ref:`Unlock` and :ref:`RefreshLock` operations are used for this
        purpose, but other lock-related operations may be used.

        The specific conditions for each response are covered in the documentation for each of the
        following lock-related WOPI operations:

        * :ref:`Lock`
        * :ref:`RefreshLock`
        * :ref:`Unlock`
        * :ref:`UnlockAndRelock`
        * :ref:`PutFile`

    WOPISrc
        The WOPISrc (*WOPI Source*) is the URL used to execute WOPI operations on a file. It is a combination of the
        :ref:`Files endpoint` URL for the host along with a particular :term:`file ID`. The WOPISrc does *not*
        include an :term:`access token`. When invoking Office Online, hosts provide the WOPISrc instead of just
        the :term:`file ID`.

        The WOPISrc is needed beyond just a file ID so that Office Online can know what URL to call back to when
        executing WOPI operations on a file. From an Office Online perspective, the WOPISrc and a :term:`file ID`
        are synonymous, since Office Online always works with the WOPISrc itself, not the raw :term:`file ID`.

        See :ref:`Appending WOPISrc` for more details on how the WOPISrc is constructed and passed to Office Online.
